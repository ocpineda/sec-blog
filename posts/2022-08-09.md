I finally installed a dash cam, and the process was more difficult than it should have been. There were so many choices, and options-- the analysis paralysis was real. After much googling and youtubing, I refined my requirements below.

### What I wanted (I thought?)

- Something easy to use. I don't need video of the cabin, 5k video, Alexa compatiblity, or multiple cameras
- Should be small and inconspicuous  
- A decent mobile companion app  
- I should be able to easily remove the camera to store in the glove box, or elsewhere
- Easy installation. I don't want to ruin my car, but paying someone a lot of money in these lean times was not my preference.

### A leap of faith, disappointment, and a solution

I orginally bought a Kenwood dashcam from Bestbuy. It was roughly $200 and garbage from the beginning. I had difficulty getting the camera to sync with my phone. When I had finally installed it in the car, it stopped working altogether. I returned it for a refund after having it for only 3 days.

After much Youtubing, and Googling, I decided on the [Garmin Dashcam 57](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/731443). It was easy to set up out the box, the app connected fairly well, and the installation was easy. I bought the [Garmin ODB2](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/735279) power cable to power it up. I tucked the cables under the headliner and trim. I had to stop by Autozone to get a plastic auto trim tool to pull the plastic part of the A-pillar on my vehicle just enough to tuck the power cable under it. This made for a very clean look.

### So how is the Garmin, and what have I learned?

I've had the Garmin 57 for 3 weeks now, and I'm happy with it. The mobile app isn't perfect, and from what I gather, pretty much all the dash cam apps are ok at best. I thought having a cam that synched with mobile app quickly was important, but I've found they all are sub-optimal. If you want to grab video from your camera, the best way is to just hook it up to your computer with a usb cable. It's quicker. The Garmin desktop apps don't look all that great, but they do work. 

Even though Garmin is not usually rated as the best dashcam, I feel they do place enough emphasis on it to fund the teams developing the cameras and apps. Kenwood, for example, has a reputation for excellent hifi audio, but the dashcam development seemed to be an afterthought. Get the Garmin 57, you'll find it adequate, and you won't have to fret like I did, and get on with your life.
