Cristian Cornea has a cool threat intelligence mind map on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6905504486266081281-5Ft4).  I half listened to the Sans Summit two weeks ago. I'll post my very sparse notes on it here later, maybe.  

Steam had [HackNet](https://store.steampowered.com/app/365450/Hacknet/) on sale for $2.99 last week. I only played around with it for a few minutes, but it seems fun.  

## Building the virtual hacking lab

I'm not even in the discovery or requirements phase of building the lab. Brainstorming some things for the lab:

- Gl.iNet travel router <https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-axt1800/>
- Docker containers, and/or Multipass
- Kali in a VM which I already have
- Windows 10
- secure the IoT devices
- look into software defined radio
- be able to remote in to my containers
