Planetary file for week of Wednesday 2022-04-27

- Via Daniel Miessler's Unsupervised learning podcast no. 327, referral to [tldrsec's "Cloud Security Orienteering"](https://tldrsec.com/blog/cloud-security-orienteering/) written by [Rami McCarthy](https://twitter.com/ramimacisabird). From there, found the [AWS Well Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html)
  - Also on Daniel's podcast I found out about [Project Discovery](https://projectdiscovery.io/#/) which has a bunch of cool open source network discovery tools which can be used for security.
- My buddy CD sent me this webinar ["How to Evaluate the Cyber Risk of Emerging Technologies—An ICS Attack Framework"](https://selinc.com/events/on-demand-webinar/136089/)
- ML sent me some OT sec links.
  - [How to use FAIR analysis with DREAD](https://www.fairinstitute.org/blog/how-to-use-dread-analysis-with-fair)
  - [CCE](https://inl.gov/cce/)
- TICS reminded me of the Stuxnet documentary, Zero Days (2016). I need to check it out one of these days.
- Last week I was looking into [CVE Markdown Charts](https://github.com/clearbluejar/cve-markdown-charts). I'd like to check that out for personal use, and work.
- MS sent me some OT security links
  - Here is a good overall description of OT and security around it 
    - <https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/operational-technology-security>
  - Nice graphic showing something’s to consider
    - <https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/operational-technology-security/documents/NIST_Control_Systems_Tips_and_Tactics_Infographic.pdf>
  - Examples of specific OT attacks over the years 
    - <https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/evolution-of-cyber-threats-in-ot-environments>
  - Colonial Pipeline was a large, in the news, widespread attack.  Ransom ware on IT side directly affected the OT network.
